# Introduction
Every year at the University of Ottawa, students enrolled in MCG2101 - Introduction to Design are tasked with designing and a modeling a machine that meets the requirements outlined in a fictional mandate written by the professor. This year, students were given the choice of either designing:
- a belt-driven rock-climbing machine
- a portable machine that autonomously builds pyramidal lodgings made of ice blocks

My teammates and I decided on the latter option.
