# Introduction
Every year at the University of Ottawa, students enrolled in MCG2101 - Introduction to Design are tasked with designing and a modeling a machine that meets the requirements outlined in a fictional mandate written by the professor. This year, students were given the choice of either designing:
- a belt-driven rock-climbing machine
- a portable machine that autonomously builds pyramid-shaped lodgings made of ice blocks

My teammates and I decided on the latter option.

## Restrictions
Among some of the restrictions detailed in the [full project report](/assets/docs/MCG2101-Final-Project-Report.pdf) are as follows:
- the machine must use an onboard "magical Peltier cooler" to produce the ice blocks in 30 seconds
- the machine may use up to five electric motors
- the machine may use contact switches to activate the motors
- no digital logic may be used (eg: microcontrollers)
- the machine should only require an operator to turn it on and off (no intervention during operation)
- the machine should be easily transportable

Suspension of disbelief:
- Assume all rotational power has infinite torque
- ice blocks are frozen in 30 seconds
- 

# Solution

- X direction
- Y direction
- Z direction

## Controller/Power Distribution
- The inspiration (Gramophone, etc)
  How to encode instructions without a computer
- Barrel cams
- Programming the cam followers
	- Optimal way to travel around pyramid
