#Introduction
Every year at the University of Ottawa, students enrolled in MCG2101 - Introduction to Design are tasked with designing and a modeling a machine that meets the requirements specified by a fictional mandate written by the professor. This year, students were given the choice of either designing:
- a belt-driven rock-climbing wall that randomizes the location of the foot/handholds
- a machine that autonomously builds pyramids made of ice intended for use as lodgings.
