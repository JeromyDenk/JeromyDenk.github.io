# Introduction
Every year at the University of Ottawa, students enrolled in MCG2101 - Introduction to Design are tasked with designing and 3D-modeling a machine according to a fictional mandate written by the professor. This year, students were given the choice of either designing:
- a vertical belt-driven rock-climbing machine
- a portable machine that autonomously builds pyramid-shaped lodgings made of ice blocks

My teammates and I decided on the latter option. This is what we came up with:

# Design Criteria & Restrictions
As part of the mandate, a number of restrictions and design criteria were placed on the design of the machine. Among some of them, which are detailed in the [full project report](/assets/docs/MCG2101-Final-Project-Report.pdf) are as follows:
- up to five electric motors may be used
- no digital logic may be used (eg: microcontrollers)
- contact switches may be used to activate motors
- the machine may only require on operator to start and stop the machine
- the machine must use an onboard Peltier cooler to create the ice blocks
- the machine should be easily transportable

In order to simplify the design-process for second-year students, the project also contained a number of "suspensions of disbelief". Some of these include:
- assume rotational power inputs have infinite torque
- ice blocks freeze in exactly 30 seconds
- assume rigid body mechanics

## The Ice Pyramid
The lodging constructed by the machine must consist of a hollow square-based pyramid with a 10 x 10 block base. It is made of 181 ice blocks each measuring 60cm x 60cm x 30cm (L x W x H). The door to the lodge is to be cut into the side of the pyramid after it is built and thus doesn't need to be accounted for.
